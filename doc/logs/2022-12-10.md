Today, I finished up the --list flag for commands.

I am continuing to write out the documentation page for the help system,
but I'm really starting to feel the need for integration tests (and unit tests)
for all the functionality that I'm adding, and that is what I will focus on today.

I will probably start by building out cliopatra and keeping a list of command line 
flags to test for.

## Styled rendering

Currently glamour kind of blindly renders out at 80 columns with color, whatever the terminal 
or pipe might be.

## Rendering out demo.gif 

I wonder if it would be fun to render out gifs for command line usage inside the markdown,
but it's probably easiest to just render out markdown for nwo (and more accessible!).

So cliopatra could take an input yaml, and render out a markdown of the description and
usage of the example.

## Help system should render out in json

Furthermore, in terms of keeping things structured into structured,
we should make the help system meta, in that it could use libglazed to render its information
in a structured format.
