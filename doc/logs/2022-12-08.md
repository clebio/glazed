It's only 4 days later and I already forgot what the next should be. 
I seem to recall that I now need to make the --examples flags actually work,
and properly gather the output of the docs commands.

After that I should merge the pull request and start working on the cliopatra command
inside this project. I can always migrate it out later on.

## cleaning up the usage vs help distinction

Help is the command that is going to get called either for an individual command 
if you do `help $command` or `$command --help`, and if you call help on its own
this command will just be that no command is found.

The help command needs the collect the help specific flags that where passed to it,
query the help sections to see which ones match, and the render them. Ok, I think this
gives me a good enough idea of the structure I want. In the general purpose help file, I 
will write a "gather all the relevant sections into a query" command.

In fact, I made this into its own section, and also wrote a builder for the query.
this is not only a nice way to build it programmatically, but it also 
gives me a way to potentially expand this to use `bleve` in the future.

## building the query engine

I built a rudimentary way of querying sections, and I always forget how to deal with inclusive
and exclusive filtering, and if I should have just done a proper functional pipeline 
to start with. Who cares, I built a couple of unit tests which actually caught an oversight
bug, and let's keep going.

I remember that I built some struct to hold the sections to be rendered for a help page
for a command. If that's already in use, I guess I probably just need to wire it up.

I guess first, I have quite some cleanup to do, and also need to add a toplevel flag 
to my query struct. All the Get* methods in help.go can now be replaced with the query engine.

## Next steps

The cats are miaowing so time to stop. 

The next steps should be:
- collect sections for help topics, flags
- properly display the help section for a topic (using a custom template in order to 
render a section and its related topics)
- the same thing showing the documentation for a flag
- adding a "no flag found, but here's a few that might be cool" kind of section in case a help runs empty
- make it possible for cobra users for example to override the display of a help section
- or in fact, extract out the templated rendering of a command help entirely out of cobra,  
  and make it more general, that way all we have to do in the cobra code is to 
  hook it up to cobra itself.

Do I want to have command markdown files, instead of mixing documentation partly in cobra 
and partly in markdown? It's valuable to have both, because people will often already 
have part of their doc in the cobra calls, and only want to augment it with some 
external markdown files.

It would be cool to point our rendering and section collating system at an external directory in the
docs command (for example glaze docs show-help-from-dir <dir> <topic> --examples).
That's not a great verb but maybe I'll think of something better.
