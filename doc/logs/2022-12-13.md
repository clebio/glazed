I quickly merged a little change to show the full example content when asking for it (duh).

## Adding `select` output

It should be possible to output the result on one single line so that it can be reused in shell
scripts. I realize now that shell argument actually already handle new line / the preferred
approach (especially with spaces) is to use read line anyway. This means that we can get there
with the table output and I don't need the select itself.

This means that I could actually just use an alias flag. Let's actually try that, and see where
it leads us.

## Something went wrong when merging or what

Somehow the help system has an output issue, and a curly brace was missing. What happened?
