## Setting up the templates for help topics and flags

I realize I can't easily unify the templates (for now)
because the cobra template is using so much from cobra and I 
don't want to move those flags and dependencies over to the more general
help package.

I will however build the machinery for flags and topics.

## Evening hacking

I got quite far (and merged) the first draft of the help system.
Of course, I didn't actually write help for the help system,
so that's what I am adding tonight (along with cleaning up a few flags).

The help system and how it all fits together is actually quite complex, and I 
realized this morning that hacking in the morning is much easier than working 
on complex stuff in the evening.

I think I can clean this up a little bit further in order to be able to write
up nice diagrams.

One thing with writing extensive help is that it needs to be kept in sync with 
the library itself. Since a lot of my documentation is actually related to individual
flags and even source files, I wonder if there are ways to not only check
that the documentation is kept up to date, but also weave help sections
together at loading time, in a literate style.

There's two ideas here. 

## Checking documentation freshness

The first is checking documentation freshness.
This would mean that when a code construct is referenced, or a 
flag or command is referenced, we can check at compile that these
flags still exist.

This is something cliopatra could do.

As for checking code fragments in the doc, I think that's something godoc can do,
but I wonder if it can do that for markdown files embedding code fragment.

## Literate programming / compile assembly of help sections

The second is to generate help sections from different sources
at compile. Currently, help sections are loaded at compile time from
markdown files.

### Runtime assembly of help pages

At runtime, help pages are composed out of:
- the CLI flag parsing's help system
- a SectionQuery
- the HelpPage created from the SectionQuery
- a template to render the help page 

The help command integration allows the user to configure the SectionQuery
and the template used to render the help page output.

### Compile time assembly of help pages

In order to keep documentation close to the source code that it is relevant to,
it could be possible to transpile / generate documentation at compile time.
This is useful to create say, man pages or static pages to describe a command
(by running the SectionQuery at compile time).

It's probably best to google about literate programming in go and see what is out 
there.

We could use that mechanism to create the help system for glazed (the github wiki
and markdown in the repo itself) that way too, so that we can have an impactful
README without having to duplicate things that are also shown in the 
individual command pages.
